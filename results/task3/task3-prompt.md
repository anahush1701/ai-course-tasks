Your code has the following issue: The PaymentProcessingService intermittently throws a NullReferenceException when deserializing the gateway’s JSON response (which can be empty or malformed), and lacks any resilience logic (e.g. retries or circuit breaker), leading to unhandled errors at runtime. Using the provided code and the logs at the end of the file identify the issue with the code and describe it in detail. Then based on the description generate the fixed code. Adhere to C# best practices, maintain clear and concise code, and add necessary comments. Use the provided code's structure, naming conventions, code style, etc.
