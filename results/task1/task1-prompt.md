**Prompt**:

> You are working with C# and xUnit test framework. Generate a complete test to verify the behavior of the CalculateOrder method in OrderService class. Use [Fact] and [Theory] methods and [InlineData] attributes if needed appropriately. Include distinct test cases for when isMember is true and isMember is false. Choose appropriate totalAmount and itemsCount values for your test cases to cover all possible options. Use the same code structure and naming conventions as provided in ShippingServiceTests. Provide only updated C# code for the whole document without conversational text or explanations outside of code comments.*


With the applied prompt cursor provided the result in *task1.cursor.cs*, gemini - *task1.v1.gemini.cs*.

As visible from the results of the prompts, gemini tends to include classes that it thinks are necessary for compilation in the code even if they were not provided. To try and remove this behavior (assuming those classes are provided somewhere else in the document, for example), the following additional prompt was used with gemini:

> From the generated code above, remove the classes and methods that were added just for compilation and that haven't been explicitly provided by the source code or required in the prompt above. Ignore their necessity for correct compilation of the file. Do not include them even as comments. For the sake of the rest of generated code assume those classes and methods are provided and there will not be any compilation mistakes.

This prompt resulted in task2.v2.gemini.cs
